<p class="top15 text-justify"><span>As Moon enters Sagittarius it causes you to feel restless and eager to explore the unknown avenues. And the fact that this is a good time to head out on a get-together with your family and loved ones should definitely make you happy. Gemini, enjoy this blissful time while you can. Do not think too hard or too much about the logistics. Let spontaneity guide you! It may not be very often that you get an opportunity where all of you are together, after all. According to Astroyogi astrologers, your high energy point will come sometime between 2 pm and 3 pm; it will be during this time that the positive energies of the cosmic event will be at their peak. Light green is your lucky color for the day.

<p class="top15 text-justify"><span>A family member or someone close may cause disappointment and create some frustrations for you today due to the presence of Moon in Capricorn. You may feel the urge to really scold and punish them. Refraining from this punitive action and explaining your position clearly instead will ensure that your loved one understands where they are wrong. Corrective action that leads to a change in behavior will lie in explanations, not in punishment. Stay away from anything which will lead to further complicate problems suggest Astroyogi astrologers. Attract positive energy by wearing Yellow today. Any time between 10:00 am to 11:00 am is considered to be auspicious for you.

However, your best bet today would be to just be accountable for your actions and be honest say Astroyogi astrologers. This time of high pressure will pass and you will be back to feeling normal again. Wear orange and reserve all important decision making between 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm.
